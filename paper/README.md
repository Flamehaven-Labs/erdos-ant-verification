# paper/

LaTeX source of the accompanying verification paper.

## Compile locally

```bash
# Requires: TeX Live (or MiKTeX), biber, latexmk
cd paper
latexmk -pdf main.tex
# Output: main.pdf
```

## Compile via Overleaf

Upload the `paper/` directory contents to a new Overleaf project. Set
the main document to `main.tex` and the compiler to `pdfLaTeX` with
`biber` for the bibliography.

## Compile via CI

Every push to `main` that touches `paper/**` triggers
`.github/workflows/paper.yml`. The compiled PDF is uploaded as a
workflow artifact named `erdos-ant-verification-paper`.

## Honesty scan

The CI workflow runs a `grep`-based scan that fails the build if any of
the following appear:

- `we prove`, `we have proved`, `we proof` (the paper does NOT prove
  any new result; the "we computationally verify" formulation is used
  instead).
- `revolutionary`, `unprecedented`, `state-of-the-art` (banned
  marketing language).

## Release-time substitutions

As of v0.1.4 there are no `<COMMIT_HASH>` or `<ZENODO_DOI>` placeholders
left in the paper sources — both are filled in with the v0.1.3 release
values:

- Commit hash: `c8fe529` (v0.1.3 release tag)
- Zenodo DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.20377950](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20377950) (v0.1.3 deposit)

For future paper-bearing releases that need to refer to a new release
tag or DOI, edit `paper/main.tex` (abstract footnote) and
`paper/sections/07_reproducibility.tex` (reproducibility table) in the
same commit that closes the new release; do not reintroduce placeholder
syntax.
